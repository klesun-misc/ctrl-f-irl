What I'd like to have when watching videos on LBRY, is to have the full database of all videos available locally, and to use
[my own](https://github.com/klesun/muramasa-vn-translation/blob/master/scripts/a05_make_prefixes_dict.js) search algorithms.

Currently LBRY lacks even such basic stuff as excluding videos with specific tag (politics, religion, crypto, etc...) and
ordering by relevance, rather than by date in descending order. 

I'd also really love to play out with user channels, playlists as from practice that seems to be a
juicy source of quality content I'm most interested in (music).

Afaik, all this info is publicitly available on the blockchain, will need to make some research.

I also looked for a reason to write something in rust for years. Finally I have some good task where performance is important!
