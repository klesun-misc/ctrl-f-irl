# ctrl-f-irl
Another genious idea for an app from me: _Ctrl+F_ in Real Life. An APK that would capture text in a document or food labels, find a substring using OCR. Irreplaceable when you are looking for a certain spices in a store. Though should research, possibly something like that already exists. That's something similar to Smartglasses I think.
