# ctrl-f-irl
Another genious idea for an app from me: _Ctrl+F_ in Real Life. An APK that would capture text in a document or food labels using phone camera and find the substring using OCR. Irreplaceable when you are looking for a certain spices in a store or a certain chemical in product ingredients. Though should research, possibly something like that already exists. That's something similar to Smartglasses I think.

Google translate has something very similar, that's where I got the idea from.
