I want to create a web site where one would be able to search for cartoons/music like you would on rutracker, and play them directly in this web site, without downloading to pc. Thanks to the amount of RAM on modern PCs and libs like [webtorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) that should be possible.

Many good streaming web sites are constantly shutting down due to becoming popular... Together we stand, brothers! More good free catoons for our internet, they can't shut us all down!

I would like to add few good indexable pages for certain cartoons that are hard or sometimes even impossible to google, like "Steven Universe" or "Rick and Morty".
