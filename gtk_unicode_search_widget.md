When typing text, press _ctrl+shift+alt+u_ shortcut, search dialog appears: enter part of unicode character name, get list of matching options, select with keyboard arrows and hit
enter, the unicode character is added to the text you were editing.

Nowadays unicode smileys and symbolic images are getting pretty popular, but the usual course of action for you to use it in your text, if it's not some messenger,
is to google it, select it's text in the description of a result, copy, return to original page, paste. The "Characters" app in ubuntu I found today is more
convenient I guess, as you don't have to wait for goolge page to load, but it still requires quite a few extra clicks, not to say that you can't use it without
mouse. Also "Characters" takes around a second to open on my ssd (calculator app as well, so I guess it's a desktop thing), I wonder if that could be sped up somehow...

Dunno if it should be a fork/PR for the "Characters" or a standalone app... in any case would need to make some research on how to make GTK, or QT, or how is it called, apps (that would open fast preferably).
