As you all know, youtube sucks.

Copyrighted content removal grows, useful features shrink. Recommendations are also garbage.

_Better Youtubeâ„¢_ would be a wrapper around youtube (like niconico once was), either as an extension, or as a separate web site, that would add all the good
stuff youtube lacks and remove all the the bad stuff youtube forces on you.

### Good Stuff Youtube Lacks
- Contributed captions.
- Playlists of 200+ videos (not sure, maybe this is possible nowadays)
- Filter to limit recommendations to only music

### Bad Stuff Youtube Forces
- Recommended damn popular meme videos even if you mark them as "Not Interested -> I don't like the video" nonstop.
It also bases recommentation on a video you watched, even if you "dislike"d it
- Stupid comments, new ones prioritized over good ones, no way to get them in strict chronological order either.
- Filter out videos by category. Like remove "today we are going to build a chair" kind of vidoes, "top 10 x" kind of videos, videos that are shorter than one minute, etc...

Basically, let user control the content he sees, rather that let youtube monopolize it.
